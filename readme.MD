# Problem

Create function named `a` in `uniqueA.js` file which maintain count of no of times this function is called.
Then create 2 files `uniqueB.js` and `uniqueC.js` which will call that initially 2 times and then 1 time again and it should print that 

# Approach Used

- Created a closure function in A and exported that closure function
- B and C are importing that function and calling that
